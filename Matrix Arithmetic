/* Question Given a Matrix A, 
Create a row vector of 1's that has same number of elements as A has rows. 
Create a column vector of 1's that has the same number of elements as A has columns. 
Using matrix multiplication, assign the product of the row vector, the matrix A, and the column vector (in this order) to the variable result. 
Think about what the result represents */
/* Solution */
A = [1:5; 6:10; 11:15; 16:20];
x=ones(1,size(A,1))
y=ones(size(A,2),1)
result=x*A*y
