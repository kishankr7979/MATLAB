/* Question: Write a function called trio that takes two positive integer inputs n and m. The function returns a 3n-by-m matrix called T. The top third of T (an n by m submatrix) is all 1s, the middle third is all 2-s while the bottom third is all 3-s. For an example,see the code below:
M = trio(2,4)
M =
     1     1     1     1
     1     1     1     1
     2     2     2     2
     2     2     2     2
     3     3     3     3
     3     3     3     3
*/
/* Solution */

function M=trio(n,m)
M=[ones(n,m);2*ones(n,m);3*ones(n,m)]
