/* Question: Write a function called next_prime that takes a scalar positive integer input n. Use a while-loop to find and return k, the smallest prime number that is greater than n. Feel free to use the built-in isprime function. Here are some example runs:
>> next_prime(2)
ans =
     3
>> next_prime(8)
ans =
    11
>> next_prime(12345678)
ans =
    12345701 */
    /* Solution */
    function k= next_prime(n)
prime= n+1;
while isprime(prime)~=1
    prime= prime+1;
end
k= prime
